            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p align="left" style="left:100px">A beauty and a beast, the prickly pear is beloved for its blossoms and
                feared for its vicious spines. Some varieties produce yellow, red, and orange cup-shape flowers that
                last just one day, while others retain their large clump of blooms for several weeks, providing delicate
                beauty among the thorns. The fleshy green pads are covered in long spines (sometimes as long as 3
                inches) as well as clusters of small, barbed hairs known as glochids, but don't let the spines deter you
                from planting prickly pear. It is also a good plant for erosion control and is deer-resistant thanks to
                its natural defense system.

            <h1> how to plant it</h1>
            <p align="left">
                It’s best to plant prickly pear cacti in the spring or early summer when temperatures are on the rise
                and moisture levels drop. If you are planting a nursery-grown or established plant, wait until the soil
                temperatures are 60 degrees Fahrenheit and dig a hole as deep and twice as wide as the pot. Place your
                cactus in the hole so that it sits at the same height it sat in the pot. Backfill with soil and water
                lightly to settle soil around the roots. Check your variety for optimal spacing, but most types should
                be planted two or three feet apart. </p>
            <h1>advices</h1>

            <p align="left"> Prickly pear is an easy-to-care-for plant that grows best in full sun and well-drained
                soil. Both drought- and heat-tolerant, this long-lived succulent plant tolerates sandy, rocky soil, and
                seaside planting places.<br>
                The prickly pear cactus thrives in full sun and will likely enjoy your yard's driest, sunniest spots.
                Indoor-grown prickly pear cacti will do best in a sunny south or west-facing window where they can get
                several hours of bright, direct sunlight and consistently warm temperatures.
                Prickly pear cacti enjoy neutral to slightly acidic well-draining soil that is somewhat sandy or
                gravelly (whether planted outside or in a container), but they can grow in other types of soil if there
                is ample drainage. That said, clay or slow-draining soil can be problematic in cool regions where
                prickly pear will sit in moist soil during winter.
                <br>
                Prickly pear cacti need very little water (which makes them excellent for xeriscaping). In fact, in many
                areas, they can survive on rainwater alone. Water them only when the soil is completely dry and, when
                you do, be careful to just moisten and not saturate the soil.
                Since prickly pear cacti are used to thriving in the desert, they do best in hot climates with low
                levels of humidity. The fleshy pads of the cactus may shrivel or droop in the winter but don’t fret.
                Cacti go through cellular changes to protect themselves from frigid temperatures and the pads should
                plump up again as the temperature rises.
                <br>
                Indoor temperatures are often well-suited for container-grown prickly pear cacti if they get plenty of
                sunlight and are protected from drafts and temperature fluctuations.
