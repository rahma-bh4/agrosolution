            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p align="left" style="left:100px">Growing a lemon tree isn't that difficult. As long as you provide their
                basic needs, growing lemons can be a very rewarding experience.
            </p>
            <h1> how to plant it</h1>
            <p align="left">
                Lemons are more cold-sensitive than all other citrus trees. Due to this cold sensitivity, lemon trees
                should be planted near the south side of the home. Lemon trees need protection from frost. Growing them
                near the house should help with this. Lemon trees also require full sunlight for adequate growth. While
                lemon trees can tolerate a range of soils, including poor soil, most prefer well-drained, slightly
                acidic soil. Lemon trees should be set slightly higher than ground. Therefore, dig a hole somewhat
                shallower than the length of the root ball. Place the tree in the hole and replace soil, tamping firmly
                as you go. Water sufficiently and add some mulch to help retain moisture. Lemon trees require deep
                watering once weekly. If necessary, pruning may be done to maintain their shape and height.

            </p>
            <h1>advices</h1>

            <p align="left"> Like most citrus, lemon trees are quite difficult to grow directly in the ground when
                winters are cold.

                Regularly give them citrus-specific organic fertilizers to give them the best chances of developing
                well.

                Growing them in pots is most adapted, because that makes it possible to bring the lemon trees to a spot
                where it doesn’t freeze in the winter.

                Lemon trees aren’t indoor plants, and can’t bear staying in a heated environment all year round. They
                need relatively lower temperatures from October to May, especially during the night.</p>
