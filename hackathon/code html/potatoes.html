            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p align="left" style="left:100px">Potatoes are one of the oldest food crops known to man and were
                cultivated by American Indians in seasons and areas that were too cold for maize. Related to tomatoes,
                Solanum tuberosum reached Europe in the 1570s and some say they were the greatest treasure brought back
                to Europe from the New World. Potatoes are inextricably linked to the explosion of the Irish population
                and its subsequent collapse. Ireland's heavy soil, abundant rain and temperate climate suited the
                growing of potatoes better than any other part of Europe. Unfortunately, the genetic base was so narrow
                that the inbred clones were susceptible to disease, which led to the Irish Potato Famine and he deaths
                of 1.5 million people between 1846 and 1851.

            <h1> how to plant it</h1>
            <p align="left">
                Prepare a large container eg. rubbish bin or half wine barrel to ensure they have adequate drainage.
                Place a thick layer of straw and well-rotted manure at the base of the container. Plant about 4
                potatoes.
                Follow the wire method above, but when harvesting it you will have to cut the bin or dig out the
                potatoes. </p>
            <h1>advices</h1>

            <p align="left"> Potatoes have their share of issues but, thankfully, most of them can be avoided with good
                planning and management. Planting multiple varieties is a wonderful natural defence, and practicing good
                crop rotation will reduce the incidence of nematodes and other pests. Avoid potato scan by ensuring your
                soil pH is balanced (not alkaline) and plant in well draining soil to make sure your spuds don't get
                water-logged.

                Resistance to pests and disease is strongest from plants grown from seed where male and female flowers
                transmit inherited ‘survival of the fittest’ characteristics, and seed potatoes sold by Diggers are
                certified and free from disease.</p>
