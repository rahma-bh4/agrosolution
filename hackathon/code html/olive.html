            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p align="left" style="left:100px">The olive tree is a perennial, evergreen tree that can live and produce
                olives for more than a century. In some rare cases, olive trees have been reported to live and produce
                sprouts at an age of 1800 years old. The tree reaches a height 15-65 ft. (5-20 meters). As it happens
                with most trees, the height of the tree is affected by the vividness of the subject or of the variety,
                the soil and climate conditions, and finally the cultivation methods used. The trunk is cylindrical,
                smooth on young trees and bumpy in older, because lumps of varying size appear as the time goes by.

            <h1> how to plant it</h1>
            <p align="left">
                The field selection and preparation is followed by labeling the positions where we will plant the
                seedlings. We must first decide the exact point where each young tree will be planted and then dig the
                proper hole with dimensions 20 inches X 20 inches (50 cm X 50 cm). We should note that the seedlings
                must be planted at the same depth as they were in the nursery. The surface soil of the pit must drop
                below the ball of the seedling. The planting of seedlings in areas where frost is not reported starts
                from late fall (November to late February), while in areas with frost the planting starts in early
                spring, when even the last frosts have passed.

                As far as the planting distances between trees are concerned, a 20 X 20 feet (6 X 6 meter) distance is
                frequently used. This is obviously a square planting system and results in 109 trees per acre or 272
                trees per hectare. If the soil is too fertile, planting the olive trees is a denser scheme will result
                in mutual shadowing. Moreover, the roots of the trees will cross each other and compete. However, there
                are also other things we should take into consideration when we decide on planting distances, ie.
                Mechanical harvesting, desired canopy shape etc. Consequently, there is an ongoing debate on the
                efficiency of dense versus sparse planting system and square, rectangle or line planting systems. The
                tree population in commercial olive orchards ranges from 150 to over 900 trees per hectare (1 hectare =
                2,47 acres = 10.000 square meters). </p>
            <h1>advices</h1>

            <p align="left"> The Olive tree thrives in areas with Mediterranean climate, where mild winters are followed
                by sunny springs and hot summers. The areas where olive trees are cultivated for commercial use must
                have an average annual temperature of 60-68 °F (15-20 °C). The absolute maximum temperature can reach
                104 °F (40 °C) without causing damage, but the minimum should not fall below 20 °F (-7 °C). Lower
                temperatures than this can cause serious damage to the trees. Of course, the temperature of 20 °F is
                only indicative, because the resistance of the tree in cold depends on other factors as well, such as
                how quickly the temperature drops, the length of the frost, the presence of strong cold winds, humidity,
                germination and health of the tree variety, weather conditions before frost etc. In general, we can say
                that the olive tree cannot not be cultivated commercially in areas where the temperature often drops
                below 20 °F (-7 °C). However, a certain amount of cold is necessary for the fruit set. This is the
                reason why olive trees cannot be grown in tropical climates.</p>
